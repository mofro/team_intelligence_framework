# Architectural Decisions: Team Intelligence Framework

This document records significant architectural decisions, the context and reasoning behind them, and their consequences for the framework.

---

## Decision 1: Two-Layer Configuration Structure

**Status**: Decided (2025-12-11)  
**Affects**: Persona activation, context management, reference loading, documentation structure

### Problem

The Persona Framework operates in multiple contexts (development, game design, financial planning, writing, etc.). Each context has:

1. **Universal rules** — How any persona activates, how context is loaded, how personas collaborate (same everywhere)
2. **Context-specific rules** — What references exist here, what behavioral protocols apply, what triggers activation (different per context)

**The trap**: Without clear separation, these rules get duplicated across contexts, creating maintenance nightmares:
- Update a universal rule? Have to update it in 5 places.
- Add a new context? Have to know all the universal rules AND all the context patterns.
- Single source of truth breaks down quickly.

### Decision

Establish a **two-layer configuration model**:

**Layer 1: Universal Framework Rules** (Single source, never changes)
- Documented in `/config/` Markdown files
- Examples: persona_activation_framework.md, persona_collaboration_framework_v2.md, persona_interaction_architecture_v1.md

**Layer 2: Context Configuration** (Domain-specific, lives with each context)
- `personas/[domain]/context_configuration.json` — Reference libraries, behavioral protocols, activation triggers, available personas for THIS context

### Rationale

1. **Eliminates duplication** — Universal rules documented once, context rules documented once
2. **Clear separation of concerns** — Framework logic stays framework; project logic stays in context
3. **Scalable** — New contexts don't require understanding universal rules; they just create a context_configuration.json
4. **Single source of truth** — Each thing lives exactly where it makes sense
5. **Maintainable** — Update universal rules in one place; update context rules in one place

### Consequences

#### Positive
✅ Clear, maintainable architecture  
✅ Easy to add new contexts (template + context_configuration.json)  
✅ Universal rules can evolve without touching every context  
✅ Context-specific protocols can be sophisticated without bloating universal framework  
✅ New team members understand structure quickly

#### Negative/Trade-offs
⚠️ Requires new config files (initial setup work)  
⚠️ Documentation must explain both layers (more docs, but clearer)  
⚠️ Some decisions require understanding both layers (not trivial)

## Decision 2: JSON vs. Markdown File Types

**Status**: Decided (2025-12-11)  
**Affects**: Configuration file organization, documentation structure, LLM interpretation consistency

### Problem

The framework supports two types of files: JSON (data structures) and Markdown (guidance). This creates a tension:
- **JSON**: Machine-readable, unambiguous, validates against schema, but less pleasant for humans to read/edit
- **Markdown**: Human-friendly, flexible, easy to explain context, but introduces interpretive drift for LLMs

**The question**: Which file type for which purpose? How do we maximize consistency without sacrificing usability?

### Decision

Separate by layer:

**JSON (Data Layer)** — Things that affect persona/team behavior
- `personas/[domain]/[persona_name].json` — Persona definitions
- `personas/[domain]/context_configuration.json` — Context behavior and activation rules
- `personas/[domain]/teams/[team_name].json` — Team compositions and dynamics
- `/teams/[framework_teams].json` — Framework-level teams

These are data structures that LLMs parse, personas reference, and contexts load. They must be unambiguous.

**Markdown (Guidance Layer)** — Documentation and principles
- `/config/*.md` — Universal framework principles (persona_activation_framework.md, persona_collaboration_framework_v2.md, etc.)
- `README.md` — Framework overview
- `ARCHITECTURAL_DECISIONS.md` — Why decisions were made
- `CONFIG_REFERENCE.md` — Schema reference guide (what data structures exist and why)
- `REFACTORING_REFERENCE.md` — Maps framework principles to persona schema refactoring decisions
- `REFACTORING_PLAN.md` — Full execution plan for persona refactoring with time estimates
- `PERSONA_FRAMEWORK_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` — How to set up new contexts
- `USER_GUIDE.md` — How to use personas and teams
- `TEAM_DEFINITION_GUIDE.md` — How to compose teams, conventions, patterns

Markdown is for humans to understand principles and for LLMs to learn how the framework *should* work.

### Rationale

1. **LLM Consistency**: JSON prevents interpretive drift for behavior-critical structures. Markdown is fine for guidance where flexibility is an asset.
2. **Human Usability**: Markdown is vastly more readable and editable than JSON for documentation. Reserve JSON for data structures.
3. **Validation**: JSON schemas can be validated programmatically. Markdown conventions must be enforced through clear guidance.
4. **Existing Pattern**: Framework already uses ~35+ JSON files for personas/teams and Markdown for documentation in `/config/`. This formalizes that pattern.
5. **Separation of Concerns**: Data layer ↔ guidance layer. Different purposes, different tools.

### Consequences

#### Positive
✅ LJSONom behavior is precise and unambiguous (JSON data layer)  
✅ Human documentation is readable and maintainable (Markdown guidance layer)  
✅ Clear distinction: if it affects behavior, it's JSON; if it's guidance, it's Markdown  
✅ Aligns with existing framework patterns  
✅ Can validate data structures; guide documentation interpretation  

#### Negative/Trade-offs
⚠️ Requires clear conventions in Markdown to prevent interpretive drift  
⚠️ Documentation must explicitly explain relationships between JSON structures and Markdown principles  
⚠️ More files (but fewer than if everything were JSON)  
⚠️ LLMs need clear guidance on which file types to reference for which purposes

### Next Steps

1. ✅ Create TEAM_DEFINITION_GUIDE.md (Markdown guidance for team composition)
2. ✅ Update CONFIG_REFERENCE.md to clarify it's a reference guide, not creation instructions
3. ✅ Create REFACTORING_REFERENCE.md (maps `/config/` frameworks to persona schema fields)
4. ✅ Create REFACTORING_PLAN.md (execution plan for refactoring all 20 personas)
5. 🔨 Review `/config/*.md` files for cross-references to Decision 1 and Decision 2
6. 🔨 Update PERSONA_FRAMEWORK_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md with conventions for reading/using both layers

## Implementation Status: Phase 1, 2, & 3

### Phase 1: Configuration Foundation & Theory ✅ COMPLETE (2025-12-11)

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ ARCHITECTURAL_DECISIONS.md created with Decision 1 & 2 documented
- ✅ CONFIG_REFERENCE.md created with complete schema specifications
- ✅ Decision 2 (JSON vs. Markdown) documented, aligning with existing patterns
- ✅ Two-layer architecture fully specified

### Phase 2: Refactor Personas & Teams Together 🔨 IN PROGRESS (Started 2025-12-11)

**Completed (2025-12-11):**
- ✅ context_configuration.json created for all 4 domains (JSON data layer)
- ✅ Created teams/ subdirectories for all 4 domains
- ✅ Moved and updated team definitions with `context` field
- ✅ All context configs reference correct personas and teams
- ✅ Confirmed Decision 2: JSON for behavior-critical configs ✅
- ✅ lore_keeper_persona_schema.json refactored as template (Decision 2 pattern)
- ✅ REFACTORING_REFERENCE.md created (maps `/config/` framework principles → persona schema fields)
- ✅ REFACTORING_PLAN.md created (full plan for 20 personas with time estimates, batching strategy, progress tracking)
- ✅ Established explicit mapping: 3 `/config/` framework files → refactoring decision checklist per persona

**Remaining in Phase 2:**
- [ ] Refactor 19 remaining persona schemas using REFACTORING_REFERENCE.md as guide
  - [ ] Gaming domain: mythweaver, ttrpg_game_architect (2 personas)
  - [ ] Development domain: developer_coding_persona, react_specialist, security_specialist, 10_foot_ui_designer, design_expert, ott_ux_persona, blits_developer, lightning_developer, cloud_architect (9 personas)
  - [ ] Financial domain: investment_advisor, tax_strategist, healthcare_expert, insurance_analyst, social_security_specialist, estate_planner (6 personas)
  - [ ] Writing domain: screenwriter, dialog_coach, science_advisor, dp_persona (4 personas)
- [ ] Create PROJECT_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md with project-specific contexts extracted from personas
- [ ] Create/update PERSONA_ENGAGEMENT_GUIDE.md with per-persona operational protocols
- [ ] Verify all persona schemas aligned with Decision 2 pattern
- [ ] Spot-check 3-4 refactored personas for consistency

**Estimated effort**: ~6-7 hours concentrated work (15-20 min per persona using REFACTORING_REFERENCE.md as guide)

**Key insight**: REFACTORING_REFERENCE.md is the bridge between `/config/` framework principles and individual persona schema field decisions. All refactoring decisions flow from framework principles → reference guide.

### Phase 3: Documentation & Guidance Layer 📚 IN PROGRESS (Started 2025-12-11)

**Completed (2025-12-11):**
- ✅ Create TEAM_DEFINITION_GUIDE.md (comprehensive guidance on team composition, collaboration patterns, anti-patterns, testing)
- ✅ Update CONFIG_REFERENCE.md to be a proper technical reference with JSON-to-Markdown mapping
- ✅ Add cross-reference table in CONFIG_REFERENCE.md showing what guidance to read for what
- ✅ Update ARCHITECTURAL_DECISIONS.md with Phase 1, 2, 3 status and key insights

**Remaining in Phase 3:**
- [ ] Review `/config/*.md` files for clarity and add cross-references to Decision 1 & Decision 2
- [ ] Update PERSONA_FRAMEWORK_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md with file type conventions and layer guidance
- [ ] Update README.md to explain two-layer architecture with examples
- [ ] Update USER_GUIDE.md with team activation and context usage patterns
- [ ] Rename PERSONA_FRAMEWORK_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md to PERSONA_FRAMEWORK_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md (all-caps per convention)

## Decision 3: Challenge/Synthesis Phase Separation

**Status**: Decided (2026-06-12)
**Affects**: Persona collaboration protocol, `context_configuration.json` schema, `/config/` files, `.claude/commands/`

### Problem

The Optimistic Skepticism Protocol — "challenge before solve" — was implemented as a behavioral rule inside a single LLM invocation. A model asked to simultaneously challenge and synthesize coherence-drifts toward synthesis. The challenge became performative: the LLM's pull toward helpfulness and integration swamped genuine adversarial interrogation. The behavioral rule was a workaround, not a design.

The root cause: genuine challenge and integrated synthesis require opposite properties. They are structurally incompatible within one context.

### Decision

Separate challenge and synthesis into **genuinely distinct execution contexts** — two separate LLM invocations with different system prompts. Challenge runs first and produces an artifact; synthesis consumes that artifact.

**Phase 1 (Challenge)**: Adversarial interrogation with no synthesis framing. Produces a structured Challenge Artifact (premise flags, risks, alternative framings, required clarifications, verdict).

**Phase 2 (Synthesis)**: Unified team response that has genuinely absorbed the challenge artifact. Primary voice system applies normally.

**Protocol-first design**: The interface contract is defined in `config/challenge_synthesis_protocol.md` as a runtime-agnostic spec. Claude Code slash commands (`.claude/commands/challenge.md`, `.claude/commands/synthesize.md`) are the reference implementation only — not the protocol itself. Any runtime satisfying the contract is valid (manual two-conversation, shell script, `llm` CLI, Jupyter notebook).

### Schema Change

Each domain's `context_configuration.json` gains one new field:

```json
"challenge_focus": "architecture_goals_and_software_correctness"
```

This scopes the Phase 1 adversarial lens to domain-appropriate objectives. The universal protocol structure lives in `challenge_synthesis_protocol.md`; domain files only override what differs.

### Files Added

- `config/challenge_synthesis_protocol.md` — Runtime-agnostic interface contract (the portable artifact)
- `config/challenge_phase_prompt.md` — Standalone Phase 1 system prompt
- `.claude/commands/challenge.md` — `/challenge` reference implementation
- `.claude/commands/synthesize.md` — `/synthesize` reference implementation

### Files Modified

- `config/persona_collaboration_framework_v1.md` → **renamed `v2.md`**: Optimistic Skepticism section now points to the protocol spec rather than describing challenge execution (which moved out). Synthesis governance unchanged.
- `config/domain_agnostic_framework.md`: Two-Phase Execution Architecture section added; Optimistic Skepticism demoted from behavioral rule to phase gate reference.
- All 5 `context_configuration.json` files: `challenge_focus` added; `optimistic_skepticism` field updated to a pointer to the protocol spec.

### Rationale

1. **Structural fix, not behavioral patch**: Moving challenge to a separate invocation removes the coherence-drift problem at the source rather than fighting it with behavioral rules.
2. **Runtime-agnostic**: Defining the protocol as a portable spec (not as Claude Code commands) means the architecture survives tooling changes. The protocol is the stable artifact.
3. **Minimal domain config**: One `challenge_focus` field per domain rather than a full repeated block keeps the config DRY — the 80% that's universal lives in the spec, domains only express the 20% that differs.

### Consequences

#### Positive
✅ Challenge phase cannot be contaminated by synthesis framing  
✅ Protocol spec is portable — works with any LLM runtime  
✅ Domain configs stay lean (one field override, not a full block)  
✅ Two-conversation manual orchestration proves the protocol is genuinely runtime-agnostic  

#### Negative/Trade-offs
⚠️ Requires two invocations for full challenge/synthesis cycle (user orchestration step added)  
⚠️ Claude Code slash commands are reference implementations only — the protocol must be re-implemented per runtime  
⚠️ Challenge artifact quality depends on the Phase 1 prompt quality; behavioral rules were implicit, protocol spec is explicit  

### Related Decisions

- Decision 1: Two-Layer Configuration Structure (the `challenge_focus` field fits cleanly into this model)
- Decision 2: JSON vs. Markdown (protocol spec is Markdown/guidance; `challenge_focus` is JSON/behavior)
