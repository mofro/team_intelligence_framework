# TTRPG System Evaluation Framework for Hero Heaven

## Evaluation Criteria (Ranked by Priority)

### 1. Player Accessibility
**How quickly and easily can new players learn and engage with the system?**

Factors:
- Number of core mechanics
- Character creation complexity
- Onboarding burden for players
- Rule lookups during play
- Accessibility for casual players

**Scoring Guide:**
- **5**: Minimal rule lookups, intuitive mechanics, 30-min char creation, new players feel capable immediately
- **4**: Light learning curve, mostly intuitive, 1-hour char creation, new players comfortable by session 2
- **3**: Moderate learning curve, some overhead, 1.5-hour char creation, new players competent by session 3-4
- **2**: Steep learning curve, significant overhead, 2+ hour char creation, new players need 4+ sessions
- **1**: Very steep learning curve, heavy overhead, 3+ hour char creation, significant barrier to entry

### 2. Mechanical Fit for Fallen Gods Progression
**How well does the mechanical progression support the narrative of fallen gods regaining power?**

Factors:
- Power progression clarity
- Loss of power mechanics
- Mythic to mundane transition
- Advancement feels like recovery
- Mechanical support for exile theme

**Scoring Guide:**
- **5**: Mechanics naturally support the narrative arc, power gain feels earned and meaningful
- **4**: Mechanics support the narrative with light adaptation needed
- **3**: Mechanics can work with moderate adaptation, some rules feel thematic misalignment
- **2**: Mechanics require significant hacking to support the narrative
- **1**: Mechanics fundamentally oppose the narrative intent

---

### 3. GM Preparation Ease
**How much prep work is required per session given your world-building focus?**

Factors:
- Prep time per session
- Mechanics overhead during play
- NPC preparation burden
- World detail integration ease
- Improvisation support

**Scoring Guide:**
- **5**: Minimal prep needed, mechanics support improvisation, GM can focus on story
- **4**: Light prep required, mechanics don't intrude on storytelling
- **3**: Moderate prep, mechanics require attention but manageable
- **2**: Significant prep required, mechanics demand focus
- **1**: Heavy prep burden, mechanics dominate prep time

---

### 4. Customization Flexibility
**How easily can you ignore, modify, or hack rules that don't serve your story?**

Factors:
- Modular rule design
- Hackability ease
- Core rules flexibility
- Optional rule integration
- Adaptation documentation clarity

**Scoring Guide:**
- **5**: Explicitly designed for hacking, rules are modular, easy to ignore whole subsystems
- **4**: Hackable with light modification, most rules are optional-friendly
- **3**: Can be hacked with moderate work, some rules are tightly coupled
- **2**: Hacking requires significant effort, some core systems resist modification
- **1**: System is brittle, hacking breaks mechanical balance

---

### 5. Community Resources
**What support ecosystem exists? Modules, community content, third-party resources?**

Factors:
- Community size and activity
- Third-party module availability
- Fan content abundance
- Official supplement pipeline
- Online community engagement

**Scoring Guide:**
- **5**: Massive community, abundant modules and resources, very active forums
- **4**: Strong community, good module selection, active online support
- **3**: Decent community, some modules and resources available
- **2**: Small community, limited resources, slower support
- **1**: Minimal community resources, little third-party support

[Concrete predictions: "New players will X by session Y", "The mechanic of Z will create the feeling of A"]

**GM Guidance:**
[Practical advice on running this system for Hero Heaven: What to emphasize, what rules to safely ignore, what will actually matter]

**Adaptation Notes:**
[Specific rules that might get in the way. Which ones can be ignored? Which need modification? What won't break if you adapt it?]

**Best For / Worst For:**
[Who this system serves well and who it doesn't. When would you choose this?]

## Notes on Evaluation

- **Player accessibility trumps everything else** - a system players love to learn will outweigh perfect mechanical fit
- **Complexity that enables fun is different from complexity that slows play** - be specific about which is which
- **Community size matters less than community quality** for a specialized narrative project like Hero Heaven
- **Some systems only reveal their true nature in play** - acknowledge when your assessment is theoretical vs. proven in practice
- **Mechanical elegance matters** - rules that support your narrative through design are better than rules you have to hack around
